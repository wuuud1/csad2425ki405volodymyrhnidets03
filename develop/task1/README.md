1. This repo will be used as the storage of the tasks and as their contribution to the teacher.
   
2. This task was about the creation and setup of the github repository
   
3. Student number - 03. Game - tik-tac-toe 3x3. Config format - INI.
   
4. So, by now i havent decided, will i do with stm32 microcontroller or the esp32, as i have both.
But probably, it will be stm. I will use the C programming language, and their IDE for developmment. Also, to make my life easier, and yours to check the next tasks later,
i will use HAL libraries, which are the abstraction of assigning 0 and 1 to the registers, i think you understand me.
From software side, this coulde be c++, and some graphical interface
